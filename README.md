The value of ln(sec(x)) can be computed using the following formula
𝟐𝒙𝟐 𝟏 𝟐𝒙𝟒 𝟏 𝟐𝒙𝟔 𝟏 𝟐𝒙𝟖 𝒍𝒏(𝒔𝒆𝒄(𝒙))=𝑽𝟐(𝝅) +𝟐𝑽𝟒(𝝅) +𝟑𝑽𝟔(𝝅) +𝟒𝑽𝟖(𝝅) +⋯
𝑤 h 𝑒 𝑟 𝑒 − 𝜋2 < 𝑥 < 𝜋2
𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑉𝑚 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + ⋯ 3𝑚 5𝑚 7𝑚 9𝑚
Write a program in C to compute ln(sec(x)) using the above given equations for user inputs. Validation of the input has to be done. The program should terminate when 2 is entered as input.
